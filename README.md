# Setting-up-and-using-Cisco-Packet-Tracer
Cisco Packet Tracer is a visual, interactive network simulation tool used for building, configuring, and troubleshooting virtual networks, ideal for learning networking concepts 

### Objective

Cisco Packet Tracer is a visual, interactive network simulation tool used for building, configuring, and troubleshooting virtual networks, ideal for learning networking concepts. It aims to enhance understanding of fundamental networking concepts such as IP addressing, routing, switching, and protocol behavior. Cisco Packet Tracer allows users to simulate real-world networking scenarios, practice device configurations using both CLI and GUI, and develop essential troubleshooting skills.

### Skills Learned

-  Installation: Installing and troubleshooting Cisco Packet Tracer
-  Interface Navigation: Understanding the Packet Tracer Interface and tools for creating networks
-  Network Design: Adding, labelling and connecting devices in a network topology
-  Device Configuration: Assigning Ip addresses and configuring devices for communication.
-  Connectivity Testing: Running ping tests to verify network communication between devices
-  Saving and Sharing: Saving projects and exporting network configurations for collaboration.

### Tools Used

***  Network devices: routers, switches, hubs, wireless access points
***  End devices: PCs, laptops, servers, and IP phones
***  Cabling tools: copper, fiber, or wireless media
***  Configurations tools: Command Line Interface and graphical settings to configure device


### Steps

Below are the key steps taken in the Cisco Packet Tracer:

### 1. Download and Install Cisco Packet Tracer:

Visit the official site of Cisco and download the packet tracer. Run the installer file and follow the prompts to complete the installation.


### 2. Launch Cisco Packet Tracer

Open the Cisco packet tracer. locate the application on your computer and open it and login in or use as a guest.

### 3. Set Up a Basic Network

3.1 Drag and Drop devices:

In the workspace, drag routers, switches, and two PC's from the device selection menu at the bottom of the right page.

3.2 Connect the device

Used the connection tool(represented by a cable icon) to connect the devices together with appropriate cables(eg: copper straight-through for PC to switch) and connecting a switch and two PC's together.

### 4. Configure device IP's

Click on each PC to access the settings and assign IP addresses for PC's, navigate to the Desktop tab and click IP configuration to assign an IP address and subnet mask. Ensure all devices are on the same network by configuring IPs within the same subnet. 192.168.1.2 for PC1, 192.168.1.3 for PC2

### 5. Test the Network

5.1 Use the ping tool:

Right click on the PC and click on the Command prompt on any PC and use the ping command to test connectivity. If the ping is successful, the network is configured correctly.
